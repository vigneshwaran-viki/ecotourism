        The landform of Tamil Nadu varies from coast to plateau to high mountain ranges in the Eastern and Western Ghats. These mountain ranges along with ecological hotspots host a diversity of flora and fauna. They nourish a variety of vegetation types such as evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, bamboo brakes, grasslands to littoral and mangrove forests. <br><br>

Besides, the state has a long coastline of more than 1,000 km and supports a variety of ecosystems such as beaches, lagoons, mangroves, mudflats and coral reefs. The small islands along the coast are rich in marine flora and fauna. The inland wetlands in the state harbour rich avifauna, with several bird species migrating from far-off countries in large numbers. <br><br>

The state has a large protected area network comprising three biosphere reserves, four tiger reserves, five national parks, fifteen wildlife sanctuaries, fifteen bird sanctuaries and two conservation reserves. The state has the distinction of establishing the first terrestrial as well as marine biosphere reserve in India - Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve respectively.  <br><br>
